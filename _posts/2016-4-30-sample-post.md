title: Lessons Learned as a Novice Developer
---
I've been in an online software engineering program (Bloc) for about six months, but I started tinkering with code years ago. Like anything else, my experience has been subjective, but these are some things I've learned along the way:

#### 1. Learning to program is not rocket science, but it takes consistent effort. 
I assumed programming was some dark sorcery for people liked math. In practice it wasn't all that different from learning a second language applied to some specific task. It was difficult at first, but once I reached a critical mass regarding my knowledge base, learning new material became increasingly easier. But the point is that consistency is key. Even taking off a few days would involve a time-sink to get back up to speed.

#### 2. Effort is easier to muster when solving a real world problem vs learning for the sake of learning.
I started learning after my brothers and I were looking for an efficient way to edit a documentary we produced. We decided to use a database program to synch our footage to our editing software so we could search our footage using parameters such as timecode, camera angle, location, subjects, and so on. My brother had a technical background and did all of the heavy lifting, but in my efforts to pitch in, I got hooked.

Once I had a basic level of competency, I was reminded of an idea I had back in law school; a legal-specific content management system. Back then, I was too preoccupied with "the level of hell Dante forgot" to take on another project, but now I had the spiritual ram to revisit the idea. I was driven by my desire to express this idea programmatically for months. In the process I recognized that problems in which I had a professional or educational stake motivated me in a way that learning for the sake of learning could not.

#### 3. To some degree, the specific language you choose to learn doesn't matter.
When I was exclusively learning FMP (database software), I didn't even know if what I was doing was considered programming. My technically minded brother saw the amount of time I spent "developing" and encouraged me to research FMP-specific positions to gauge its value in light of the time I was investing. I found there were few job listing requiring FMP as a core skill, and employers looking for FMP developers were non-technical companies looking for someone to maintain an existing database.

This research put my knowledge base into perspective and spurred me to learn more widely used technologies. I don't work with FMP anymore but my experience building databases provided a working understanding of tables, associations, and SQL. Knowing these concepts made it easier when I formally started to learn Rails, models and Active Record. Everything builds on everything else, and getting started is more important than where you start.

#### 4. Structure and feedback have been my best friend.
Before I began learning Rails formally, I had no idea how all the pieces of a web app came together: I didn't know how an app "lived" on the web; or how links and forms related to the request and response cycle; or how a browser interacted with a server or database. That I wasn't able to see how these interrelated components fit together was a reflection of being self-taught. I envy self-taught programmers, but I am not one of them.

I'm not saying I wasn't able to learn a ton on my own; I don't think I would have got this far without being self motivated to learn as much as I did before enrolling in Bloc. But without the structure of a formal curriculum or consistent feedback from a mentor, I would have continued to inefficiently bounce from one programing area to another, learning them in parallel without quite seeing how they fit together.

#### Conclusion
Programming isn't easy but it's not rocket science. Don't get too caught up in the Quora debates about which language is better to start learning. Just get started and stick with it. Personalize the process by using actual problems you want to solve in the real world; you can use the preexisting motivation as fuel. Also, it's easier to internalize programmatic patterns if you can relate them to concepts you're already familiar with. Finally, figure out your learning style and roll accordingly.
